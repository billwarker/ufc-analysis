# UFC Pay-Per-View Analysis

Over the past few years, I've become more and more of a fan of mixed martial arts and the UFC. From devestating knockout punches to devestating chokeholds to devestating arm bars, there's just a certain thrill in watching two people beat each other close to death. As one UFC commentator describes the sport, MMA is "high level problem-solving with dire physical consequences".

It's just a curious fact that violence brings folks together. When big fights come around, viewing parties at bars and homes around the world have people tuning in to watch their favourite fighters compete. As a business, the UFC relies on selling Pay-Per-View access to watch their main events. This puts pressure to organize on the company to orchestrate the most exciting fight cards possible - and this excitement is dictated by the talent and charisma of the UFC's fighters.

In this exploratory analysis, my goal is to examine how the UFC's PPV sales have changed over time. Is the UFC selling more PPVs now than in the past? Which fighters bring in the most PPV buys, and how is the UFC promoting events with this in mind? How dependent is the UFC on "superstars" to keep itself growing? I'm going to focus the past 10 years of numbered UFC events (excluding smaller Ultimate Fighter and Fight Night events), dating all the way back to UFC 80 on January 19th, 2008.

This dataset was made by scraping information from the infoboxes on each event's Wikipedia page and PPV data from Tapology.com; it is publically available for anyone to download/analyze at this link: _____.
